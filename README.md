# RgbConverter
 
A simple color converter, it converts the rgb numbers from the 255 to the 1 format and it has an option to reverse the process,
it was designed for arma 3 format but there's an option to disable it

## How to use this:
Input format: firstNumber,secondNumber,thirdNumber,fourthNumber ex: "100,154,255,255"

Reverse format: firstFloat,secondFloat,thirdFload,fourthFloat ex: "0.6,0.5,1,1"

## Next Updates:

How to use included in the app;

You will be able to specify your own format and it will be saved;

All params will be saved so when you close and open the launcher you'll have the same params then before;
